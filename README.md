# School_District_Analysis
## Overview

Standardized test data for mathematics and reading were analyzed for PyCity Schools to provide the school board with information to assist in making decisions regarding school budget allotments. Analysis includes a summary of performance by the overall district and an aggregation by school within the district. Performance in relation to student funding, school size, and school type is reported. 

After examination of original data files, a suspicion of academic dishonesty of altered scores for 9th grade math and reading at Thomas High School arose.  As such, the affected data were removed, and remaining data reanalyzed. This report describes the impact of redacting this data on the overall district summary and the corresponding aggregations. Data were analyzed and reported using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The first analysis included all the math and reading scores provided in the data set. The second analysis included the data that remained after ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School were removed. The code used to remove reading scores is pictured below. The code was then refactored  to remove math scores.

Each point below addresses how the removal of this data impacts various reporting of the results.

* *District Summary* 

   The overall passing percentage is defined as the percentage of students who earn a passing score in both math and reading. The performance levels shown
   in each figure below indicate that the removal of the ninth-grade data for Thomas High School bears little impact when examining the district as a 
   whole. This decrease in overall passing percentage is minimal.

* *School Summary*

  When aggregating the data by school, only the results for Thomas High School is impacted by removing the data. At first glance, it appears that the
  overall passing rate for Thomas High School decreases significantly. However, the analysis of the data at this point has had the data points replaced 
  with NaN but the students are still in the data set. The students were counted by school name so when calculating the percentage of the overall passing,
  the 9th grade students are still included in the total students at Thomas High School.  Thus, this result is unreliable.

  Modified Analysis:

  The code was refactored to replace each percentage on the Thomas High School summary with percentages using only data points from tenth, eleventh, and 
  twelfth grade students.

   After this analysis, it appears that the overall passing rate does not change significantly. However, when using this school summary to compare to 
   other schools, it should be noted that all other schools were analyzed using grade levels 9-12 whereas Thomas High School accounted for only 10-12
   grades.

* *Thomas High School Performance*

   When initially examining the overall passing percentage of schools ranked in the top five and bottom five, Thomas High School was ranked number
   two. Similar to the impact observed in the School Summary results, the decrease in performance is so slight it doesnâ€™t displace Thomas High School from
   the second rank. Again, however, it should be noted that the comparison of students from Thomas High School is no longer consistent with the other 
   schools  due to the change in grade populations.

* *Grade Level Scores*

   Removing the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School only impacts the grade level scores for that grade at that school. All scores at
   other locations remain the same as well as the remaining grade levels at Thomas High School.This allows for more similar comparisons among the schools 
   by examining students at grade level.

* *Scores by School Spending*

  Thomas High School falls in the $631-$645 spending range (per student) so this is the only row that has the potential to change. As represented in the
  tables below, the data has actually not changed with the new analysis. This data is calculated by taking the budget and dividing by the number of
  students in the school. The data modification only changed the original scores for 9th grade to NaN, however, the students were not removed from the 
  data set so the total students stayed the same. The only calculation that took into consideration the adjusted student total excluding 9th grades were 
  the percentages in per school summary for Thomas High School.

* *Scores by School Size*

   Thomas falls into the medium school size so this is the only row that has the potential to change. In both the original and modified, this calculation
   was based on the total amount of students, including the ninth grader student at Thomas High School. Similar to the observations made in the district
   summary, the impact is minimal. In fact, when rounded to the nearest percent, no change can be observed.

* *Scores by School Type*

  Thomas High School is classified as a Charter school so this is the only row that has the potential to change. Again, this analysis was completed using
  the total student count, consequently, there is no difference among the results of each analysis when rounded to the nearest percent.

## Summary

In summary, there was little change in the school district analysis after the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School were replaced with NaNs. The following observations can be made:

1. The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School decreased 0.3%.
2. The overall passing percentage for district also decreased by 0.3%
3. The average math score for the district decreased 0.1 points. 
4. There were no changes to the data regarding school type, school size, and school spending.
